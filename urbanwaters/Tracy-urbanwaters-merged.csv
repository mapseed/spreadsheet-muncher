A 2002 Ecology assessment found that continuing phosphorus control is needed in the Lake Sawyer watershed to help the lake meet and maintain water quality standards into the future. The diversion of Black Diamond’s wastewater treatment discharge from the natural wetland above Lake Sawyer to a sewer line successfully reduced the majority of nutrient input to the lake and significantly helped the lake to recover. Since re-directing Black Diamond’s wastewater away from Lake Sawyer, there has been a steady decline in phosphorus but the lake still has too much. Ecology developed the Lake Sawyer Total Phosphorus Total Maximum Daily Load Water Quality Implementation Plan, a follow up document to the 1993 TMDL. The Lake Sawyer Steering Committee will serve as sounding board for implementation projects, monitoring updates, and adaptive management. Black Diamond will continue to contract with King County’s Lake Stewardship Program to monitor phosphorus in Lake Sawyer to track trends in lake quality and enable adaptive management.
