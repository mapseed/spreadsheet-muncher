Approximately 700 linear feet, including rock armoring, of the old Fenster Levee will be removed to form a low, vegetated bench and gently sloping river bank to provide shade and overhanging cover, better accommodate floodwater and attenuate floodwater velocities. LWD will be installed along the toe of the bank slope and on the vegetated bench to provide cover and hydraulic complexity. The riparian zone landward of the set back levee prism will also be densely planted with native riparian trees and shrubs to improve wildlife habitat and provide allochthonous inputs to the river. A relict channel that was partially filled decades ago when the property was in agricultural use will be excavated to provide off-channel habitat and reestablish floodplain connectivity. Phase 2. The City of Auburn will use this funding to reconnect the Green River (RM 32) with a portion of its historic floodplain. The project will a) remove up to 800 feet of the existing Fenster revetment berm, rock, and the associated gravel access road adjacent to the river channel; b) construct a new buried-toe revetment ‘setback levee’ approximately 300 feet landward of the river; and c) install flood fencing, control invasive riparian plant species and install native riparian plants.",,,"{{unlisted}}","A","n/a","Fenster Levee"

A 2002 Ecology assessment found that continuing phosphorus control is needed in the Lake Sawyer watershed to help the lake meet and maintain water quality standards into the future. The diversion of Black Diamond’s wastewater treatment discharge from the natural wetland above Lake Sawyer to a sewer line successfully reduced the majority of nutrient input to the lake and significantly helped the lake to recover. Since re-directing Black Diamond’s wastewater away from Lake Sawyer, there has been a steady decline in phosphorus but the lake still has too much. Ecology developed the Lake Sawyer Total Phosphorus Total Maximum Daily Load Water Quality Implementation Plan, a follow up document to the 1993 TMDL. The Lake Sawyer Steering Committee will serve as sounding board for implementation projects, monitoring updates, and adaptive management. Black Diamond will continue to contract with King County’s Lake Stewardship Program to monitor phosphorus in Lake Sawyer to track trends in lake quality and enable adaptive management.

During this construction, steel sheet piling is used to isolate contaminated soil and water from the river. PCB contaminated soil is excavated and hauled offsite to a licensed waste landfill. Several unanticipated underground storage tanks and barrels containing waste oil and other remains have been uncovered on-site; but there have been no impacts or threats to the community from the discovery and handling of these materials. Air quality and noise are monitored daily during all construction activities, and artificial light is measured during any night work. Air quality levels have consistently been below the limits set by the project, which are below Federal and State guidelines. Sediment cleanup will be performed during the open fish window (December 2013 – February 2014) when in-water construction is less likely to harm migrating or spawning fish, or interfere with tribal fishing.",,,"{{unlisted}}","A","n/a","Terminal 117"
